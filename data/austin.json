Sitting on a base of sorghum cane juice and dark brown sugar, Sun Eater is bittered with rosemary and infused with dried lemon peel. It is highly-attenuated for a dry and refreshing finish similar to that of a cider or champagne. This gruit was designed to beat back that Tyrant Sun of hot Texas weather, which is practically year-round, so grab a 6-pack and head out into the world!"
